# Simple LMS with Token Rewards

## 1. Project Title
**Simple LMS with Token Rewards â€“ Basic Learning Paths**

## 2. Project Description
This project is a simple Learning Management System (LMS) on the Stacks blockchain that incentivizes learners with fungible tokens upon successful course completion. It uses Clarity smart contracts to ensure transparent and tamper-proof tracking of learning progress and token rewards.

## 3. Project Vision
To provide a decentralized and transparent e-learning platform where users are rewarded for learning. This creates a dual motivation system: gaining knowledge and earning tokens that may have value or utility within an ecosystem.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add support for multiple learning paths and quizzes.
- Integrate with NFT certification on course completion.
- Create a web3 frontend for learners.
- Gamify learning with levels, badges, and leaderboards.
- Allow DAOs or educators to fund courses via smart contract.
